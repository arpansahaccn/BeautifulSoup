# all the texts inside the webpage is shown #




>>> soup  = bs4.BeautifulSoup(res.text , 'lxml' ) # object soup from bs4 i want method BeautifulSoup passing arguments the stored file response.text and and  xlml the tree structure used ,python lib for analysing html.
>>> type(soup)# defineing our object of type BeautifulSoup , so it is no longer the object of requests.

>>> soup.select('.toclevel-1') # object soup calls select which calls the class mw-headline.
>>>  # prints what inside the class .toclevel-1 # now there are a lot of unwanted information in the class but we only want the text inside the class
>>> for i in soup.select('.toclevel-1') # running a for loop to get the text inside the class.
