We were initially attracted by the fact that it could extract data from websites that other similar services could not (mainly due to its powerful Relative Select command). The team at ParseHub were helpful from the beginning and have always responded promptly to queries. Over the last few years we have witnessed great improvements in both functionality and reliability of the service. We use ParseHub to extract relevant data and include it on our travel website. This has drastically cut the time we spend on administering tasks regarding updating data. Our content is more up-to-date and revenues have increased significantly as a result. I would strongly recommend ParseHub to any developers wishing to extract data for use on their sites.</p>\n                            <h4>&#8212;\n  David Mottershead, Owner at\n                                <span class="testimonial-company">\n                                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visitnorthwest.com/">Visit North West</a>\n                                </span>\n                            </h4>\n                          </div>\n                        </div>\n                      </blockquote>\n                    </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <a class="carousel-control left" href="#carousel-testimonials" data-slide="prev">\n            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>\n          </a>\n          <a class="carousel-control right" href="#carousel-testimonials" data-slide="next">\n            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class="row landing-page-row odd">\n    <div class="landing-page-responsive">\n      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">\n        <div class="blurb-description">\n          <h2>Scrapes any interactive website</h2>\n          <p>\n            Trying to get data from a complex and laggy sites?\n            No worries!
